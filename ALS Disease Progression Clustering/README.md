## Problem
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that affects patients differently in terms of symptoms, progression rate, and response to treatment. This variability makes it difficult for clinicians and researchers to design effective, personalized treatment plans or to predict disease progression accurately.
## Method
Clustering ALS patients with similar clinical features, genetic markers, or progression patterns. By identifying these hidden subgroups, researchers and healthcare providers can gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms and tailor interventions to specific patient profiles.
## Tools used
Python
## Key insights
The clustering analysis identified meaningful groupings within the ALS patient data, suggesting distinct disease progression patterns. Some overlap between clusters indicates shared clinical features among certain patients. Additionally, several data points fall outside the main clusters, representing potential outliers. These cases may reflect atypical ALS presentations, such as rare genetic variants, uncommon symptom profiles, or distinct progression trajectories, and may warrant further clinical or research investigation.
