## Objective:
To identify yearly trends, seasonal patterns, assess state-level disaster activity and the FEMA assistance programs utilization from 1953 to 2023 to provide data-driven insights that can support improved disaster preparedness, more effective resource allocation, and enhanced mitigation planning in high risk regions.

## Dataset
The dataset summarizes FEMA disaster declarations from 1953 to 2023. It is sourced from the FEMA website (https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2) and exists in the public Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/us-natural-disaster-declarations).

## Tools
Python, Power BI

## Key Findings
- A long-term increase in disaster declarations from 1953 to 2023. Major spikes around 2005, in 2012 and in 2020 (COVID19).
- Disasters activity peaks in March and September, while the quietest months are November and December. The remaining months — January, February, April, May, June, July, August, and October show moderate totals.
- Texas is the most disaster-impacted state. Kentucky (KY), Missouri (MO), Oklahoma (OK) also rank high. All the other states have moderate or low disaster activity declared.
- Disaster types are diverse across the U.S. Severe storms, hurricanes, and floods are the most frequent. Then come the wildfires, Tornadoes, snowstorms, freezing events with moderate declaration levels. Rarer declarations include coastal storms, earthquakes, drought, volcanic eruptions, and typhoons.
- High demand for Public Assistance (PA) and hazard mitigation (HM) efforts.
## Recommendations
To strengthen disaster response and preparedness:

- Prioritize additional funding and resources for high-risk states (more support for emergency training, infrastrure hardening & community resilience programs)
- Optimize PA delivery (modern assessment tools, expand pre-disaster planning with states) and strengthen HM investments in the most vulnerable hazard zones (funding, long-term risk reduction projects) to reduce future disaster federal spending & recovery time.
- Prepare targeted seasonal readiness plans before March and September (prepositioning ressources and increasing communication) to improve rapid response and reduce the impact of predictable seasonal hazards.
- Review and enhance assistance for low disaster activity states & territories to ensure equitable access to federal disaster support.
- Establish a long-term strategy for recurring hazards (multi-year resilience planning, using historical data to create data-driven risk reduction strategies)
