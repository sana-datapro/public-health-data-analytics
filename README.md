# public-health-data-analytics

As a recently graduated student with a scientific background and a passion for turning data into actionable insights, I am motivated by public health challenges and by the role data can play in making people’s lives safer and healthier. I am particularly interested in how data analysis can support evidence-based health programs and better decision-making.

From a data perspective, I see data as a key resource for understanding complex health and population-level challenges. This repository includes two projects: an exploratory analysis of disaster declarations in the United States from 1953 to 2023, and a clustering analysis focused on grouping patients affected by the neurodegenerative disease ALS.

I am actively expanding this repository with additional projects related to public and global health, with an emphasis on analysis, measurement, and real-world relevance.
