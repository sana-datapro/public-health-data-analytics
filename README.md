# public-health-data-analytics
As a recent graduate student in data science with a scientific background and a passion for turning data into actionable insights, I believe I can contribute meaningfully to making people’s lives better and safer. I am especially motivated by public health challenges such as diseases and disasters, and by the idea of building more efficient and effective health programs.

From a data perspective, I see data as a powerful resource to better understand these challenges and support a more sustainable and resilient world. This repository includes two projects: an exploratory analysis of disaster declarations in the United States from 1953 to 2023, and a clustering analysis aimed at grouping patients affected by the neurodegenerative disease ALS.

I am continuing to expand this repository with additional projects focused on public health and global health topics.
